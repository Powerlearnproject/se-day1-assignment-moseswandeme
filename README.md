Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering ; is a branch of computer science that focuses on design,development,testing and maintenance of software programs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Structured Programming ; this has led to better code maintainability.
2. Object-oriented Programming ; it has enabled modular and reusability of the code.
3. The Internet Era ; It has led to the rise of distributed systems.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning ; It involves getting information from the customer and documenting them.
2. Design ; Its the creation of the blueprint of the sofyware for example , user interface ,system interface and databases.
3. Testing ; It ensures that the software meets the requirements and it functions properly.
4. Deployment; Moving the software to the operating environment.
5. Maintenance; Monitoring of the application for issues that arise once it's in the production.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Flexibility; Its so fifficulty to accommodate changes in the waterfall methodology once development starts but in Agile method the scope can be changed basing on changing needs.
2. Frequency on customer feedback; In waterfall method the customer feedback is only gathered at the beginning of the project while in Agile there is a continous feedback from the customer.
3. Waterfall methodology uses linear progreassion whereby each phase of development must be completed before moving to the next while Agile the projects are broken down into smaller cycles with regular feedbacks and adjustments.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
     Software Developer
The role of the software developer is to design , code,building, deploying and maintaining software application by analyzing user needs, planning archtecture, write code, testing functionality and ensuring the software meets the required specifications and functions properly.
     Quality Assurance Engineer
 The role of a quality assurance engineer is to establish and maintain standards to ensure that a product or service consistenly meets the required level.
      Project Manager
 He or she organizes software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to specification of tasks.   


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
         IDEs
They provide a comprehensive suite of tools within a single interface to boost developer productivity by streamlining the coding process through features like syntax highlighting , code completion,debugging, version control integration and built automation.
This allows the developers to write ,test, and deploy code more efficiently and with fewer errors.
Its examples are;
1.Visual Studio ; Widely used for .NET development.
2.Eclipse; Supports various languages
3.Pycham ; designed for python development.
       Version Control
 They allow developers to track changes made to code over time,enabling collaboration,easy rollback to previous version if needed,efficient bug fixing and improving project management.
 Its examples are;
 1. Git; Widely used in distributed system that allows efficient branching and merging.
 2. GitHub; Is a popular hosting platform for Git reposotories.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Debugging of the code; This is a challenge especially when dealing with large codebases.The creation of communities where an individual can post the code and can get help in debugging it can provide remedy to this challenge.
2. Keeping up with technology; this is really a challenge because the softwares that we are using today may not be in use next year , the new ones emergy that requires training on how to develop them.The solution to this challenge is to urge the software developers to embrace and relearn how to develop emerging softwares especially in AI tools.
3. Managing deadlines; This is a challenge indeed , the customer may require the  application to be fully functioning at a certain date this makes the developer to have sleepless night just working on the software development.The solution to this is to be honest to the customer and set the deadline that is realistic and also apply Agile methodology for software development because you will adjust the specification than waterfall where you cant make any change on the requirements.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing; is the isolation of the individual code component , this helps in improving code quality , identifying the code bug early and verification of the correctness of the code.
2. Integration Testing ; It examines how different components interact with each other, it helps in identifying the data transfer errors.
3. System Testing ; Is the evaluation of the entire system against requirements.Its importance is to ensure that all features work as expected and the system functions properly in real world scenario.
4. Acceptance Testing ; This is a user-centric testing.Its importance is to confirm whether the software meets business requirements and is acceptable for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt Engineering
 Is the practice of carefully crafting specific instructions to guide an AI model particularly a generative AI like ChatGPT towards producing the desired output by providing context, examples ,and precise phrasing to help the model understand the intent and respond accurately to a query or task.
 
 Its  importance is that it helps generative AI models better comprehend and respond to a wide range of queries,from the simple to more technical.Good prompts equal good results hence accuracy.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   A prompt that "All Africans are thieves". This is not correct because we have Africans who earn money from legitimate businesses and working as employees with different organizations.
 The prompt query should be "Are SOME Africans , thieves?. If the prompt  result is Yes then we must agree to the model because yes , some are conmen/women who run ilegitimate businesses like money laundering businesses( wash-wash).
